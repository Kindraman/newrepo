# SpeedUp in C/C++ Quicksort algorithm comparison.
Modular Program in C/C++ that implements OpenMP for parallelize quicksort and then compare to secuencial quicksort,
To get the SpeedUp, it is not optimized but it works!
Also prints a text file with ordered arrays (both)

The size of the array always have to be power of 2, also the number of threads to avoid segmentation fault.
